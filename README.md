# ParabolaX

A **NixOS user**, **Emacs enjoyer**, and long-time **Lisp fan** who likes systems that stay simple and respect the user.  
I care about free software and enjoy understanding how things actually work.

## Philosophy
- Software should empower users, not lock them in.  
- Emacs is my workspace; Lisp is how I think.  
- Prefer clarity, minimalism, and reproducibility.

## Interests
- NixOS & declarative configuration  
- Emacs customization, Lisp, and general tooling  
- Problem solving and algorithmic thinking  
- Free software and open ecosystems  

## Current Setup
- **OS:** NixOS  
- **Editor:** GNU Emacs  
- **Languages:** Lisp, C, Go, Java, and shell scripting  
- **Approach:** “Keep it minimal. Keep it free.”
